## Problem Statement  
Urban areas worldwide are facing increasing challenges in managing solid waste effectively. Overflowing garbage bins, inefficient collection routes, and lack of public engagement lead to unhygienic conditions and environmental degradation. The challenge is to develop a smart, responsive, and scalable waste management system that not only monitors real-time bin statuses but also encourages citizen participation and uses data-driven decisions to optimize collection and processing.

---

## Abstract  
*Zero Waste* is a full-stack, smart waste management platform designed to digitize and automate the way urban waste is monitored, reported, and collected. Using a combination of hardware sensors, a modern web application, and Supabase for backend services, the system enables real-time tracking of waste bin fill levels, generates optimized collection routes, and creates an interactive dashboard for both municipal authorities and citizens.

The goal is to empower city administrators with actionable data, minimize fuel and time wastage in collection processes, and foster environmentally responsible behavior among residents. Citizens can log in to report issues, monitor local bin statuses, and view waste segregation tips. Authorities can access analytics, alerts, and performance dashboards.

This scalable solution leverages open-source tools and is designed for easy integration into smart city infrastructure.
